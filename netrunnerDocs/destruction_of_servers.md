# Destruction of Servers

The Corp cannot choose to destroy a server when installing cards; at
least one card must be installed for other cards in or protecting the
server to be trashed.

If there are no cards installed in or protecting a remote server, then
the server immediately ceases to exist. If a server ceases to exist
during a run, then the run ends immediately after any currently open
paid ability windows close. Unless the run has passed step 4.4 of the
timing structure of a run, it is not considered to be successful or
unsuccessful.
