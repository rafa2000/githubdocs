# Recurring Credits

Recurring credits are placed on a card when the card becomes active, and
can be used immediately. Recurring credits do not stack; a player
replaces recurring credits up to the number listed on the card when his
or her turn begins. This occur at step 1.2 of the turn, before any
conditional abilities can be triggered. Recurring credits are only ever
replaced up to their current value, not removed.
