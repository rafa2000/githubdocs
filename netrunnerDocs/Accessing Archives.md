# Accessing Archives

When accessing cards in Archives, the Runner turns all cards faceup in
Archives before accessing them. Then he or she accesses and resolves
individual cards one by one, in any order he wants.

If the Runner uses a replacement effect, then he or she does not turn
any facedown cards faceup.
