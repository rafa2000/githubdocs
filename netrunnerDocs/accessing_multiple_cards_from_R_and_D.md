# Accessing Multiple Cards from R&D

The Runner can intersperse accessing cards from R&D with any upgrades
installed in the root of R&D. The Runner cannot choose to access the
cards in R&D out of order.

***Example**: The Runner has an R&D Interface installed and makes a
successful run on R&D. He accesses the top card of R&D, and afterward
chooses and accesses an upgrade installed in the root of R&D. The Runner
then finishes accessing cards by accessing the second card of R&D.
