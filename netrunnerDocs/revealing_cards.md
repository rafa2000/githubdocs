# Revealing Cards

If a Corporation card is not visible to the Runner when it is trashed or
discarded, then it is sent to Archives facedown. If a Corporation card
is visible to the Runner when it is trashed or discarded, it is sent to
Archives faceup.

If a specific card or card type in an inactive state is chosen by a card
effect, the Corporation must show that card to the Runner without
changing its faceup or facedown status. The Corporation only reveals the
card if it was facedown and the effect says he must reveal it.
