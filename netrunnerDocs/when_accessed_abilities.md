# When Accessed Abilities

A card with an ability that triggers when the card is accessed does not
have to be active in order for the ability to trigger. When resolving
such an ability, simply follow the instructions on the card.

***Example**: The Corporation does not have to rez Project Junebug
before the Runner accesses it in order to use its ability.*
